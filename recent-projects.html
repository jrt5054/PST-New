PST worked with <a href="https://optoknowledge.com/">Opto-Knowledge Systems Inc. (OKSI)</a> to develop two powerful computational methodologies for fusing missile plume model predictions with sensor measurements to produce highly accurate missile signature databases. The first methodology, A-SCOPE (Automatic Simultaneous Constraint Optimization for Parameter Extraction) automatically extracts optimal inputs to the government standard plume signature prediction codes that: (1) are physically realistic within their known covariance, and (2) produce signatures that are the most consistent with sensor measurements.  The second methodology, MODEX (Model Extrapolation) compares plume signature predictions and sensor measurements to derive extrapolation factors, which anchor the predictions to the data. These factors are then used at off-measurement conditions to create a database of signatures at all possible viewing conditions, flight parameters and spectral regions. </p>
